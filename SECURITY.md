# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Older versions of the Action do not receive security updates. To ensure your system remains secure, we strongly recommend sticking to major releases (lemisieur-services/adguard-rewrite@v1). You can automate these updates using tools like [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for taking the time to report a vulnerability. Please DO NOT create an issue on GitHub because the vulnerability could get exploited. Instead please write an email to [me@lemisieur.com](mailto:me@lemisieur.com).
